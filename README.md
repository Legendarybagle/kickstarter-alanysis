# Analysis Of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project
  Take the data given From Louise about Kickstarter Campaigns and using reformatting, pivot tables and graphs make it more readable and discover trends
  
### Purpose
  Making the data more readable makes it easier to determine trends in the data. Analyzing the trends can help increase the odds of a successful campaign in the future.
  
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

  The graph shows that most of the campigns created in the middle of the year did best, and also that there were more proposed during this time. The percentage of successful campaigns stays relatively similar throughout the year with about twice as many succeding as failing, however the successful campaigns take a dip in the Oct-Dec. It is possible this is because backers want to save money for the holiday season and are less likely to donate. The first few months things begin to pick up again and peak in May, then drop back down. May appears to be the time when people are most likely to back a campaign and therfore the best time to start a campaign around.
  
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

  the graph shows that the cheaper your goal the more likely it was to succeed. This makes sense as the higher goals need to get that lesser amount and then more after. The data toward the end is less reliable as there were less campagns with goals that high, for example the "45000 to 49999" range only had one campaign so we don't really know why it failed.
  
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
  I didn't have any conceptual challenges but had some annoying parts when copy and pasting formulas by forgetting to put dollar signs in the one I was copying after changing other data in the cells I pasted so I had to manually add them all in later. Everything else was just syntax stuff or formulas i hadn't used before which were were easy to figure out either throught the documentation or with a google search for what I needed.
  
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  Two conclusions that can be made from the Outcomes Based on Launch Date are Campaigns are more likely to succeed in the middle of the year and campaigns are the most likely to fail close to december.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  From Outcomes based on Goals I can conclue that the less expensive the goal of the kickstarter is, the easier it is to meet and therefore more likely to succeed.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  Some limitations of the data set were the lack of donation insentives as that can be a big factor in how much money is donated, having a lot less data for campaigns with higher goals making the analysis less reliable, and some of the subcategories were broad enough to encompass very different things (Ie. technology/wearable could be a smart backpack or Nighvision goggles which have very different markets).
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  We could make graphs of name length vs outcome, country vs outcome, country vs pledged, staff pick vs outcome, subcategory vs outcome within a parent category as well as many others. All these would tell us more info about what people are more likely to donate and why
